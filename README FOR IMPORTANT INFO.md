Just want to say that the original person to make this EFI folder was this person:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k1qAjuCLlk
Before you do this just know that this may not work with Latitude E7440.
This only works with BigSur and won't work with Monterey, if you do then it will boot into the installer and let you install it but not boot into macOS
Monterey after you install it because I can't figure out how to update OC.
If you figure out how to update the OC files and it boots into monterey then shoot me a email @lovetant001@gmail.com

Things that are working:
✔ All USB ports
✔ Camera and Microphone
✔ All basic macOS BigSur features

Things that are not working:
❌ Finger scanner
❌ Card scanner
❌ Dell WiFi card (just buy a wifi usb adapter

Make sure to get your usb ready using guides from https://www.olarila.com
Just want to mention that you do not need to change EFI partition back after you edit it to fit this efi folder.
